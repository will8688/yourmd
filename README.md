#I chose to use:

* hapi as a server as I have played with it before
* good for debugger and reporting
* jest for testing

#possible improvements

* lowercase both search and dictionary for possibley better restult, would need more requirements to implement this as "HA" causes bad results.
* verb removal these words could be kept in a separate array/db

#Setup

npm install
npm start
npm test
